    This is intended as a snapshot of primitive keys to primitive values. These
    are not packaged for immediate use but rather intended for serialization,
    transport and logging. For example, a Gunka unit may take a KeyValueStore
    as one of its inputs.

    Parameter objects get their values from a KeyValueStore at need. This
    process may produce rich output, but a KeyValueStore cannot, by itself,
    produce richer representations of its raw data.
