# Introduction

Snisku provides a model of application parameters. Here, weâ€™ll use the example
of sound output volume as a parameter tracked within an application, building
from a trivial implementation in this document to something safe and useful in
other documents.

## Trivial exploration

Snisku is object-oriented. Its parameters are objects. To create a parameter,
you instantiate a class with a
[hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html) key, such as a string.

```python
from snisku.param import BaseParameter
vol = BaseParameter(key='output_volume')
```

The key is the only necessary argument. It is used to retrieve values for the
parameter. For example, a parameter can find a corresponding value by key in a
simple Python `dict`, also known as a hash map.

```python
value = vol.retrieve({vol.key: 100})
```

In this example, `value` will be the integer 100. `vol` will not be changed.

Snisku parameters are stateless. They never store anything like a current
value. They only coordinate the storage and retrieval of parameters in various
ways.

This does not cover every feature of Snisku, nor does it go into detail. Snisku
code has extensive built-in documentation and type annotations for ease of use
and deeper learning.
