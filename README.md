## Snisku

This library provides a model of portable application parameters. It’s named
for the Lojban word *snisku*, meaning roughly “symbol transmission”.

Snisku is intended to provide an intermediate level of abstraction in mid-size
applications that need to save, load or transmit their parameters
programmatically but are too small for a database.

Snisku is a sibling project of [Gunka](https://github.com/veikman/gunka) but
neither depends upon the other.

Snisku is in a beta stage. Its API is not guaranteed to be stable.

### Installation

Snisku is a regular Python 3 package with an optional, trivial Debian
GNU+Linux build target. Refer to the included Makefile.

### Usage

Refer to [project documentation](doc/).
